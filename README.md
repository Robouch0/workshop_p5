# Workshop - Discover p5 library and learn about JS

# Introduction
Hi, welcome to this workshop ! 

Today, we'll be diving into JavaScript basics and exploring a library called [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). 

This lib contains a collection of pre-written functions meant for creative coding.
It can simplify the process of creating simple interactive visuals quickly in a web browser.

Let's start ! 

Documentation for the p5.js library: [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)


# Part 1 - The basics


# Exercice 00 - P5.js Editor

Ok you are now in a basic code editor, take some time to familiarize yourself with it.

You should see two functions already written : 
``` setup() ``` and ``` draw() ```

Search in the documentation to learn about their purposes,
and then try changing the background color and adding a circle shape with a different color !

# Exercice 01 - Variables in JS 

Now we are gonna talk about variables in JavaScript ! Unlike his little brother TypeScript, JS does not need to precise a type before declaring a variable.
Because the type of the variable can dynamicly change while the programm is running.

In C you would write this : 

``` int nbr = 5; ```

In JS you could write this :

``` â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ nbr = 5; ```

Oh no, the keyword before nbr has been corrupted !!

I guess you need to search on the internet the different ways of writing a variable in JS :p

When you are done searching, try to create a variable to gradually change things on your image, such as the color of the circle, or his position !

# Exercice 02 - Mouse Events 

Ok it's cool we have circles, colors and all, but none of this is interactive, it's time to change that !

The exercice is simple : I want you to code a button and a slider, to add interaction with the background.

For example your button could turn off the light and put all the display color to black, while your slider could change the background color progressivly.

In order to do this your gonna have to learn how to check if a point is in a circle, how to get datas about your mouse position and if it's clicked, etc.

  Those P5.js functions may help you achieve your goals :
  
  > line() 

  > dist() 

  > constrain()

  > map()

  > mousePressed(), mouseReleased(), mouseDragged();
</details>

# Part 2 - Data structure - Keep it up !


# Exercice 00 - Arrays 

Now that the basics are set, let's move on to other important things like structuring our data, starting with arrays!

Arrays in JS are very powerful tools. They are what we call "objects" and they come with "methods" link to them, those are functions used to do things with the array.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything right away, try searching on the internet what can be done with JS array

The exercice is simple, display a grid made of squares, and when you click on them they change from blue to green (or any color that you'd like :)

Example :

# Exercice 01 - Custom Objects

As you've seen in the exercise before, arrays are really useful objects.

But wouldn't it be nice to create your own custom objects?

For this exercise, you will have to make multiple ellipses grow and disappear if they reach a certain size.

Search on the internet what a class in JavaScript is and what a constructor is. Then, with this information, create your own Balloon class and handle multiple balloons at the same time! 

They could have different sizes, positions, colors, etc.

Example :

# Part 3 - Generative Art

# Exercice 00 - Picasso ? No.

We're nearing the end of this workshop, you will now have to create a little programm generating random painting ! 

Ok ok calm down, when i say "painting", i mean a group of different shapes of different colors, you can choose how and where to display them, it's up to you !

You could learn about other forms of generative arts on the internet through tutorials, and also start to use the noise() function for a smoother randomness regarding your animations !!

Using what you've learn on arrays, mouseEvents and custom objects you could also add some interactions :

That's it !  This workshop is finished !

If you wanna go further you could learn about how to handle 3D objects with p5 libs, for example cubes, using the box() and different rotate() functions !
The possibilities are then only limited to your own imagination limits !!
